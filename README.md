Arwes is a web framework to build user interfaces for
web applications based on science fiction and cyberpunk styles guidelines, animations
and sounds effects. The idea is to **provide an user experience as if you were using
futuristic out of a movie interfaces** for your project.

The tools are based on [React](https://reactjs.org) for components,
[JSS](http://cssinjs.org) for styles,
[react-transition-group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) for
animations, [Howler](https://howlerjs.com/) for sounds and [Prism](http://prismjs.com)
for code highlighting.

> Currently is under development with an alpha version available on npm. API may change.
